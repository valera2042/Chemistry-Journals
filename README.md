# Recommendation of the jourals to submit your research paper 


This project is aimed to students and professors
who want to speed up the research papers submission process 
and save up the money for the submission to the research journals.
To submit the paper the individual generally pays 300-5000$ depending on the journal
with no guarantee for the successful publishing.

Therefore, the careful selection process must be taken before every 
paper submission. 

How the application works?
Type in the area of your research interest

The programm will run the search and give you a list of journals of interest.
They will be sorted by the impact factor in descending order.

The data was scraped from Wikipedia webpages associated with Chemistry journals.
