# Journals recommendation system for chemistry researchers

# Overview and Motivation
This project is aimed to students and professors who want to speed 
up the research papers submission process and save up the money 
for the submission to the research journals. To submit the paper 
the individual generally pays 300-5000$ depending on the journal 
with no guarantee for the successful publishing. This app will 
provide you with recommended journals to which you can submit your research
papers.

How this application works? Type in the area of your research interest.
The programm will run the search in the journals description dataset column
 and give you a list of journals of 
interest. They will be sorted by the impact factor in descending order.

I scraped this data from Wikipedia pages using Beautiful Soup.

Here is sample of a dataset:
